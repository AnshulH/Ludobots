# Ludobots
3d bot simulations

Generating a random assortment of body parts with different color for sensors and links. 

![Bot Creation logic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnshulH/Ludobots/assign7inProg/IMG_3953.jpeg)

Cubes are the only shapes possible now and motor/sensor neurons are assigned randomly. Movement is haphazard as there is no defined fitness function for randomly generated bodies at the moment. Sensors have a mind of their own and will not bend to anyones will.
